# The goal of this file is to implement a double integtor. 


# perhaps a different model needs to be defined depending on the method used. 


# Things in common with the methods: 
# state and control penalties, constraints, initial state, reference trajectory, horizon, time step. 

# will need an adapter for each different kind of model though. 



# reference trajectory
# initial state
# penalty matrices
# horizon
# time step
# constraints
